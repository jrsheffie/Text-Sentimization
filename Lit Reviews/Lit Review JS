the 2024 U.S. Presidential Race
Samsir et al. (2024) conducted a machine learning-based sentiment analysis of public discourse on X 
(formerly Twitter) during the final phase of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. 
Using a dataset of 500 annotated tweets, the study applied fine-tuned BERT models 
for sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative) and 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.

Key contributions include:

Sentiment Distribution: 54.2% of political tweets showed positive sentiment, 
particularly toward major party candidates.

Temporal Trends: Engagement spiked during key events (e.g., debates), 
showing strong correlations between sentiment and campaign milestones.

Topic Modeling: LDA revealed five major themes: economic policy, 
healthcare, climate change, social justice, and foreign policy.

Engagement Insights: Positive tweets gained 20â€“30% more interactions 
than negative ones, though negativity spiked during controversies.

The study showcases the power of transformer-based models and thematic 
modeling to capture real-time political sentiment online. Limitations include platform bias (X-only) and a two-month observation window. Future work could explore cross-platform sentiment patterns and larger, multilingual datasets.
