# Literature Review

Mathapati et al. (2017) analyzed the use of the Naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment analysis as compared to other methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Entropy in a probabilistic model. The researchers proposed building an interface which could ingest and provide a sentiment analysis from a variety of data sources such as social media comments or online marketplace product reviews. The paper heavily emphasized the importance of normalizing data in the pre-processing stage by taking steps such as removing usernames, categorizing hashtags as its own column, removing linked URLs, sending all strings to lowercase and removing any additional whitespace. The team briefly described the Naive Bayes algorithm and why they propose that it is a better algorithm to use for sentiment analysis as it has fast training times given that SVM and Maximum Entropy require more time to classify and process the input data.
